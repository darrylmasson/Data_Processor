1. Installation

Before calling make, create a file called Paths.conf in the same directory as the Makefile. In this file, you'll need to specify INSTALLDIR, where the executable will be put, and CONFDIR, which is where the config/ folder is (typically $(shell pwd)). Then, call make install.

2. Usage

$ ./NG_dp --file yymmdd_hhmm --source source --io_dir /path/to/rawdata/folder [--level L] [--config configfile] [--moving_average npts] [--position detectorpositions] [--verbose] [--very_verbose] [--help] [--NG_current I --NG_voltage HV] [--version]
Notes: the rawdatafile is only the timestamp supplied by wavedump: the rawdata/ and .dat are automatically added.  Source is the source used for acquisition (if Cf-252 detector posotioning is required. Can be passed with as arg as a string of format "r0=#,z0=#" etc in no required order. "r*=#" (or z*) will set all coordinates to a single value).  io_dir specifies the location of the rawdata and prodata folders. Config is an alternate configuration file located in config/.  --versions prints installed versions and exits. --level # selects the desired processing level - 0 is Event only, 1 is Event and Method (default), 2 is Event, Method, and Discriminator, 3 is Discrimimnator only (fails if level 1 has not been done).

3. Discription of functionality

Processed raw data taken by wavedump.  The configuration file is located in config/ and contains values like fast and slow integration times for each valid digitizer.  The output of the processing is a root file with the same timestamp as the raw data file and is located in prodata/.

4. Details of processing levels

- Level 0 (Event): computes basic info about waveform such as baseline, peak locations, heights, and widths, and the integral
- Level 1 (Method): computes the parameters used in different PSD methods
